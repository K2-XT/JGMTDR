# JGMTDR

Original Project Date: November 2020
Target iOS: 13.6
Xcode Version 11

This is recipe app that is meant to get straight to the point and display the recipes you want to find. I originally came up with the idea for another class I had at the time, mobile app development. In mobile app development we had to create a simple server and website that used javascript and interacted with our server. I took the server and simple database that I made for that website and copied it over here, then made this app as my final iOS development project.

I've got to say that I actually really enjoy iOS development. While I do think that it is a bit easier to interact with API's in Android and companion libraries, I don't think nothing is quite as effective at helping you make clean, beautiful apps as Apple's Swift and Xcode interfaces. This app demonstrates my ability to use Swift to make simple apps that can still be presentable and clean to a user. It also shows that I can work with an API using Swift, and that I do have knowledge within iOS development.
